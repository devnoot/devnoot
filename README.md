### Welcome to My Profile!

Hello ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Anthony (aka `noot` / `Climhazzard` online). 

I am a Web Developer living in the Greater Philadelphia Area with a passion for music, retro gaming, artificial intelligence, coffee, and all things tech.

I also have a big passion for great food. I post recipes and photos regularly to [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thekingnoot) and [noot.sh](https://noot.sh) (my blog).

Outside of the tech and culinary world, I enjoy playing guitar (and any other instruments I can get my hands on).
